  - title: Short Course on Causal Inference with Panel Data

      This workshop series gives an overview of newly emerged causal inference methods using panel data (with dichotomous treatments). We start our discussion with a review of the difference-in-differences (DiD) method and conventional two-way fixed effects (2WFE) models.
      
      We then discuss the drawbacks of 2WFE models from a design-based perspective and clarify the two main identification regimes: one under the strict exogeneity (SE) assumption (or its variants) and one under the sequential ignorability (SI) assumption. In Lecture 2, we review the synthetic control method and discuss its extensions. In Lecture 3, we introduce the factor-augmented approach, including panel factor models, matrix completion methods, and Bayesian latent factor models. In Lecture 4, we take a different route and discuss matching and reweighting methods to achieve causal inference goals with panel data under the SE or SI assumptions. We also discuss hybrid methods that enjoy doubly robust properties.

      This is the first course in a four-course sequence on quantitative political methodology at Stanford Political Science. Political methodology is a growing subfield of political science which deals with the development and application of statistical methods to problems in political science and public policy. The subsequent courses in the sequence are 450B, 450C, and 450D. By the end of the sequence, students will be capable of understanding and confidently applying a variety of statistical methods and research designs that are essential for political science and public policy research.

      This first course provides a graduate-level introduction to regression models, along with the basic principles of probability and statistics which are essential for understanding how regression works. Regression models are routinely used in political science, policy research, and other disciplines in social science. The principles learned in this course also provide a foundation for the general understanding of quantitative political methodology. If you ever want to collect quantitative data, analyze data, critically read an article that presents a data analysis, or think about the relationship between theory and the real world, then this course will be helpful for you.

      You can only learn statistics by doing statistics. In recognition of this fact, the homework for this course will be extensive. In addition to the lectures and weekly homework assignments, there will be required and optional readings to enhance your understanding of the materials. You will find it helpful to read these not only once, but multiple times (before, during, and after the corresponding homework).
