I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Administration and Policy at the [School of Public Affairs](https://spa.asu.edu/), Arizona State University, and a Graduate Research Assistant in the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies ([CSTEPS](https://csteps.asu.edu/)).

His current research focuses on public management, citizen-state interaction, public employee wellbeing, local government, and climate adaptation. His most recent projects are examining the implication of organizational setting and work characteristics on interaction between public organization and citizens as well as how public organizations address climate challenges to ensure public service delivery and organizational survival.  He is also interested in qualitative methods, survey methods. My research has been published in interdisciplnary outlets such as *PlOS ONE*, *International Journal of the Commons*, *Water Alternatives*, *Vaccines*, and *Women's Health Reports*.

Prior to joining ASU, I received his master's degree and bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University in 2022 and 2019. My previous research centered on common-pool resources governance and institutional analysis, with a specific focus on water resources.
